        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML elements are composed of an opening tag and and a closing tag represented with angle brackets</li>
          <li>The [head] element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. 
          Elements included within the [head] are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The [body] element contains the content that is shown to the user. 
          All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. 
          Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>The [title] element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The [style] element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The [base] element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The [link] element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The [meta] element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The [script] element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The [charset] element sets our character encoding.</li>
          <li>The [http-equiv] element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
          <li>The [viewport] element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
          <li>The [body] element is an example of a semantic HTML element. 
            In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. 
            When possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser. 
            Semantic HTML also plays an important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, 
            including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>
          <li>Not all elements are semantic, though. 
           It is still common to see non-semantic elements such as [div] to create a division in the page, 
            or [span] to create an inline division. Sometimes these are simply the most efficient solution to a structural problem the developer is trying to solve. 
            The most important thing to keep in mind is that it is best practice to use semantic elements whenever possible, especially when the content is visible to users.</li>
          <li>The [h1], [h2], [h3], [h4], [h5], and [h6] elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents. 
            Headings are exactly what they sound like: larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page. </li>
          <li>The [p] element represents a paragraph or block of text. You'll use this element extensively to wrap most of the text on your webpages</li>
          <li>The [ul], [ol], and [li] elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
          <li>The [img] element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. 
            The [img] element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The [br] element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content. </li>
          <li>The [a] element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The [href] attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
          <li>The [section] elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>

        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
       <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. 
        For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
        <li>The margin property acts much like a margin in a word processing document. A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. 
          The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
       <li>The padding property is often confused withmargin, but it is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. 
        When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! 
        That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
       <li>To understand this better, it is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box. 
        Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content. This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model.</li>
       <li>a [link] element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
       <li>The [rel] attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
       <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a relative path. 
        This means the location is derived from the current location</li>
       <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</Li>
       <li>The first declaration addresses the width of the element at __% of the available width.</li>  
       <li>The margin property assigns __px to the top and bottom, and the auto value to the left and right.</li>
       <li>The border property assigns a border with a width of _px that is solid and gray.</li>
       <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. 
        A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color. 
        In our example, the X offset is _px and defines the width or extent of the shadow on the X axis (or to the right of the box); 
        the Y offset is _px and defines the extent on the Y axis (or just below the box). 
        We haven’t defined the blur or spread radius here, but you’ll learn more about this in time. We’ve used an HTML hexadecimal code to define the color.</li>
